# Script for processing climate data in bash

Script for processing data from [Institute of Meteorology and Water Management website](https://danepubliczne.imgw.pl/data/dane_pomiarowo_obserwacyjne/dane_meteorologiczne/dobowe/opad/). The main aim of this project is to transfer data from csv files into different catalogs, that are divided into years, months and days of the occurrence of precipitation.
To run this script:

```bash
   ./script.sh '<name_of_the_catalog_to_store_data>' '<data_file_name_1>' '<data_file_name_2>' ... '<data_file_name_N>'
```

Script was made for Linux classes during my studies.
